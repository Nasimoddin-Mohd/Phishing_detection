# Leveraging Machine Learning to Combat Phishing Threats

## Overview

This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of websites, the model can classify whether a site is legitimate or a phishing attempt, helping to protect users from online scams and security threats.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset for model training.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant features from websites to improve detection accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements and compares different machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective one for phishing detection.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to assess model performance.
